if penalty lambda is high then no cuts is the right solution and we get the solution quickly
if lambda is low than there are usually many cuts, so chances are we find alot of bad ones, but since the graph is much smaller, after a few rounds
alls constraints are added.
if lambda is just right (0.2 for simple.png) we get only a few cuts, and when they are bad, we would need to add huge amount of constraints
